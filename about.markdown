This blog has emerged from the necessity to instigate some meaningful discussion about Greek language education in the UK and particularly in Cardiff. For years, the Greek School in Cardiff has tried to explain that it is not a service that is delivered to paying customers, but instead it is a collective activity with a focus on education and culture. Transactional relationships of parents with the School do not help the community and they do not help the School committee. Both the School committee and the parents need to stop considering the School as a place where education is delivered for a fee. The parents ARE part of the school and as a group they must fight to maintain it and improve it.

In recent years the School has turned towards commercialisation and "product" delivery and at the same time there is a lack of any meaningful discussion for crucial decisions about it. Collective decision making is necessary to maintain a coherent community.

Let us have a meaningful and open discussion as a group of parents about the future of the School and the community.

This blog aims to be an agent for initiating discussion about the School and the Greek and Greek-Cypriot community in Cardiff.
