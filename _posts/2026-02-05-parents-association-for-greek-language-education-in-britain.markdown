## Towards a network of Greek language schools in Britain

The high number of Greeks living in Britain means that Greek language schools in many major cities are required. These inevitably serve many rural areas as well with students travelling to attend lessons or opting for online classes where available. This has led to a significant number of Greek language schools in Britain but with a variety of provision. This has the following consequences:

1) There is a lot of duplication in terms of administration of the schools and no coordination for the optimal use of the limited resources available, resulting into different costings and fees structures, different governance and different decision making bodies.

2) Students have different experiences depending on the school that they attend. These experiences may be substantially different to a degree that they may affect the learning and development of students. 

At the moment the families and the students from different schools have limited visibility of practices and experiences in other schools. Good practice that is followed in one school is difficult to communicate to other schools. Problems occuring in one school may have been resolved in other schools but the lack of communication means they need to be resolved again in silos. Families wish to know what the standards and experience is in other schools and how their child's experience compares.

For the above reasons it is necessary to consider a body that allows communication across schools and for parents to share their ideas and concerns.

With this article we propose to establish the *Parents Association for Greek Language Education in Britain*: initially an informal body to assist with the coordination of communication of parents across schools in Britain and to examine the scope and structure of a formal organisation when required.
